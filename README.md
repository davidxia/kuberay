KubeRay is an open source toolkit to run Ray applications on Kubernetes.
It provides several tools to simplify managing Ray clusters on Kubernetes.

- Ray Operator
- Backend services to create/delete cluster resources
- Kubectl plugin/CLI to operate CRD objects
- Native Job and Serving integration with Clusters
- Data Scientist centric workspace for fast prototyping (incubating)
- Kubernetes event dumper for ray clusters/pod/services (future work)
- Operator Integration with Kubernetes node problem detector (future work)

## Documentation

You can view detailed documentation and guides at [https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/](https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/).

We also recommend checking out the official Ray guides for deploying on Kubernetes at [https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/index.html](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/index.html).

## Quick Start

* Try this [end-to-end example](helm-chart/ray-cluster/README.md)!
* Please choose the version you would like to install. The examples below use the latest stable version `v0.4.0`.

| Version  |  Stable |  Suggested Kubernetes Version |
|----------|:-------:|------------------------------:|
|  master  |    N    | v1.19 - v1.25 |
|  v0.4.0  |    Y    | v1.19 - v1.25 |

### Use YAML

Make sure your Kubernetes and Kubectl versions are both within the suggested range.
Once you have connected to a Kubernetes cluster, run the following commands to deploy the KubeRay Operator.

```sh
# case 1: kubectl >= v1.22.0
export KUBERAY_VERSION=v0.4.0
kubectl create -k "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/ray-operator/config/default?ref=${KUBERAY_VERSION}&timeout=90s"

# case 2: kubectl < v1.22.0
# Clone KubeRay repository and checkout to the desired branch e.g. `release-0.4`.
kubectl create -k ray-operator/config/default
```

To deploy both the KubeRay Operator and the optional KubeRay API Server run the following commands.

```sh
# case 1: kubectl >= v1.22.0
export KUBERAY_VERSION=v0.4.0
kubectl create -k "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/manifests/cluster-scope-resources?ref=${KUBERAY_VERSION}&timeout=90s"
kubectl apply -k "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/manifests/base?ref=${KUBERAY_VERSION}&timeout=90s"

# case 2: kubectl < v1.22.0
# Clone KubeRay repository and checkout to the desired branch e.g. `release-0.4`.
kubectl create -k manifests/cluster-scope-resources
kubectl apply -k manifests/base
```

> Observe that we must use `kubectl create` to install cluster-scoped resources. The corresponding `kubectl apply` command will not work. See [KubeRay issue #271](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/issues/271).

### Use Helm (Helm v3+)

A Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.
It can help users to deploy the KubeRay Operator and Ray clusters conveniently.
Please read [kuberay-operator](helm-chart/kuberay-operator/README.md) to deploy the operator and [ray-cluster](helm-chart/ray-cluster/README.md) to deploy a configurable Ray cluster. To deploy the optional KubeRay API Server, see [kuberay-apiserver](helm-chart/kuberay-apiserver/README.md).

```sh
helm repo add kuberay https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay-helm/

# Install both CRDs and KubeRay operator v0.4.0.
helm install kuberay-operator kuberay/kuberay-operator --version 0.4.0

# Check the KubeRay operator Pod in `default` namespace
kubectl get pods
# NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# kuberay-operator-6fcbb94f64-mbfnr   1/1     Running   0          17s
```
